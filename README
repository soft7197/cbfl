# README

This repository contains the experimental results used in the evaluation of a classification-based fault localization approach.

## Structure

The `results` folder stores the issue classification results and the final predicted buggy locations.

## Evaluation Criterion

A predicted location is considered correct if it is a **superset of the ground-truth location**, consistent with the evaluation criterion used by the baseline methods.
