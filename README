Here is a cleaned, concise, and anonymous-safe version with corrected spelling and minimal wording, while keeping your headings:

---

This repository contains the experimental results used in the evaluation of a classification-based fault localization approach.

## Structure

The `results` folder stores the issue classification results and the final predicted buggy locations.

## Evaluation Criterion

A predicted location is considered correct if it is a **superset of the ground-truth location**, consistent with the evaluation criterion used by the baseline methods.

If you want it even more minimal (e.g., for strict artifact checks), I can compress this into 2–3 lines only.
